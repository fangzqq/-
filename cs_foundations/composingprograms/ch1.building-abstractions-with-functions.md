# Building Abstractions with Functions

The computer science as a discipline is built upon an elegant and powerful set of fundamental ideas:

- all computing begins with representing information
- specifying logic to process it
- designing abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic

Mastering these fundamentals will require us to understand precisely how computers interpret computer programs and carry out computational processes.

Statements & Ecpressions, computer programs consist of instructions to either:

- compute some value, expressions typically describe computations
- carry out some action, statements typically describe actions

Functions encaplulate logic that manipulate data.

Objects bundle together data and the logic that manipulates that data, in a way that manages the complexity of both.

Interpreters interpret code in a predictable way.

Functions are objects, objects are functions, and interpreters are instances of both.

Some guiding principles of debugging:

- test incrementally
- isolate errors
- check your assumptions
- consult others
