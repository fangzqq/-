# Quick Hacks

## 45-minute hack

Your goal is to reduce the time between idea and implementation until the start is just a thing you do. Like eating and breathing. Eventually the start will feel natural and you can move on to the next project.

## create ten critique

And after each sloppy 45-minute hack, sit down and review how you did. This process of “create then critique” is what’s going to help you improve in the future.

## process before every session

For a process, an early programmer should do the following:

- Read the description of the task and write down notes. This is your research phase and you need to gather as much information as you can in written form.
- Take your research and _turn it into a TODO list_ of what you need to do to implement the hack. Write down everything you can think of for the task. What files will you need to make? What directories? What features? What libraries will you use?

Once you have the TODO list you are ready to start the timer, then do this:

- Pick the first simplest task on your TODO and do it. Do you need a file? Make it! Do you need a directory? Make it!
- Check that what you just did works
- Cross that task off and do the next one

Nearly every process is simply “make a list, do it, check it.”
