# Graph Theory

Graphs are all around us because they are a great way to diagram interconnected items, people, ideas, or pieces of data.

## Graph Theory Vocabulary

Graphs are used formally to represent a collection of interconnected objects. You can think of a graph as an object containing data points and their connections.

As an equation, a graph is `G = (V, E)`. G stands for graph, and V describes a set of vertices or nodes.
