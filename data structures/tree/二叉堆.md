 # 优先队列与二叉堆

 The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called a binary heap. A binary heap will allow us both enqueue and dequeue items in `O(logn)`.


The binary heap has two common variations: 

- the min heap, in which the smallest key is always at the front, 
- and the max heap, in which the largest key value is always at the front.

## 二叉堆的结构特性

二叉堆首先是一个完全二叉树。
